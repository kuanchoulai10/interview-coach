The hire/no-hire decision is given as a spectrum, ranging from low confidence to high confidence. This is illustrated below:
- For junior engineers, a hire recommendation is given if they showed positive signals on nearly all of the six focus areas.
- For senior engineers, a hire recommendation is given if they showed positive signals on nearly all of the six focus areas AND at the level we would expect for senior engineers. Otherwise, a no-hire recommendation is given.
- For staff engineers, a hire recommendation is given if they showed positive signals on nearly all of the six focus areas AND at the level we would expect for staff engineers. Otherwise, a no-hire recommendation is given at a staff level, although they may give a hire recommendation at a senior level.
